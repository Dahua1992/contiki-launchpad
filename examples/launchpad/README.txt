This folder contains some examples that demonstrates different things with
Contiki and stuff I wrote for my Launchpad Contiki port, such as the pwm- or
adc-modules.

I suggest you start by checking out the examples in roughly this order:
  blink
  button
  readadc
  pwm
  readserial-printf
  blink-rtimer
  
and if you are interested in these, and have the hardware for it,
  periodic-broadcast
  servomotor
