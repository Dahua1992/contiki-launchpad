This folder contains some examples that demonstrates different things with
Contiki and stuff I wrote for my Launchpad Contiki port, such as the pwm- or
adc-modules.

I suggest you start by checking out the examples in roughly this order:
  blink
    etimers, processes
  button
    button API
  readadc
    ADC API
  pwm
    PWM API
  servomotor
    PWM API with absolute period setting, using project-conf.h, changing PWM freq
  readserial-printf
    getting serial input
  blink-rtimer
    rtimers
  
and if you are interested and have the hardware for it,
  periodic-broadcast
    radio communication, Rime networking stack
